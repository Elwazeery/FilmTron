# FilmTron — Independent Tron Creative Desktop Application

**Owner-approved:** 2026-10-20 · **Repository state at this commit:** documentation-only. **NO upstream source imported, fork completed, native binary tested or cloud MCP deployed by this commit.**

**Product:** Professional non-linear video editor, color/sound suite and captioning tool.  
**Canonical repo:** `Elwazeery/FilmTron`  
**Approved upstream:** [`storytold/filmcraft`](https://github.com/storytold/filmcraft) — preserve full upstream history, remote, licensing, NOTICE and ability to sync.  
**Creative product independence:** not part of GemiMotion. No shared project engine, no merging repos, no dependency on GemiMotion to function.  
**Unified Cloud MCP:** [GemiTron88/GemiMCP](https://github.com/GemiTron88/GemiMCP) is SOLE platform cloud MCP runtime owner. This product is sole owner of its native commands, file formats, editing project and adapter. Its individually addressable MCP resource will be `https://mcp.gemitron.net/products/film/mcp` **(PROPOSED, not deployed)**.

## Required user outcome

Preserve and substantially improve the existing open-source application: native Windows/macOS editing, project stability, performance, broad pro functionality (project bins, linked media, multi-track timeline, trims, clips, transitions, audio mixing, keyframes, captions, grading, proxy/performance, render and delivery), real saved editable assets, predictable undo, trustworthy rendering, error recovery and premium usable UI. Do NOT replace the native application with a thin browser dashboard or general AI chat client.

**Brand:** FilmTron, built with versioned GemiTokens **Inferno Pixel Glass** + GemiFontSans/appropriate licensed icon assets; original elegant app chrome, restrained glass/pixel motifs, real accessibility/Arabic/English support and shortcuts, ergonomic pro layouts. Preserve neutral/correct preview color.

**Identity:** ONLY central `auth.gemitron.net` and **Gemi Access within Studio** for project/role/capability grants. Browser PKCE for desktop. No standalone password store, no local login requirement to open owned offline projects.

**Licensing:** ONLY GemiGuard (product/edition/features/seat/device/offline Ed25519 lease); preserve existing editable user projects during cloud outage/expiry, respecting licensed feature policy. Do not invent a second licensing DB.

## AI-assisted operation

The assistant's intelligence is in the connected ChatGPT session; this application never requires a separately built AI chatbot or paid external AI API. Full CRUD of each meaningful implemented UI action/property must be backed by the **same native command engine** and be available through the cloud MCP resource. A shared outbound-only Desktop Agent bridges authenticated commands to the local app with exact project/device/user grants, readback, preview, revision, safe staged writes, and undo.

**100% native UI ↔ command ↔ cloud MCP parity is a future acceptance criterion, NOT a completed claim.** No fake tool success or mock render.

**First actual acceptance scene:** Import source footage, make a frame-exact trim/track title/mix edit over cloud MCP; preview; undo; export decodable video with exact timing; reopen project.

### Source import guard

This repository started empty and documentation was added **before upstream code import**. During the future real fork, retain source history by properly merging/reconciling upstream Git ancestry and licensing. Do not replace this repo with a shallow zipped copy; do not call the documentation commit a functional fork. Use actual upstream/target commit references and acceptance checks.
